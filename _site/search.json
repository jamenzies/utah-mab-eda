    "text": "In 2022, Tucker Carlson, a popular cable news host, highlighted a controversial COVID-19 policy in Utah:\n“In Utah, COVID patients are triaged by a scoring system [for antibody treatments]…]. [R]ace often counts more than physical health. The State of Utah, for example, gives two points simply for not being white [while] congestive heart failure earns one point.”\nThe Utah Department of Health faced criticism for their race-based triage system, which prioritized non-White patients for monoclonal antibodies.\nI obtained the underlying data to determine if UDOH’s results replicate."

This involved transforming these text-based columns into factors.\nDummy Variables: For the purpose of regression analysis and other statistical methods, I created dummy variables for categorical columns (sex, race, ethnicity) using one-hot encoding."

The cleaned and processed data forms the foundation of the insights and conclusions presented on this website."
