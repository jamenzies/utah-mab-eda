This involved transforming these text-based columns into factors.\nDummy Variables: For the purpose of regression analysis and other statistical methods, I created dummy variables for categorical columns (sex, race, ethnicity) using one-hot encoding."

The cleaned and processed data forms the foundation of the insights and conclusions presented on this website."

    "text": "Is it fair to deny someone medical treatment because of their race?\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utah Department of Health decided to triage a scarce (but effective) treatment for COVID by giving patients a “risk score”. In a decision many civil rights lawyers flagged as illegal, they allocated additional points to patients based on their race.\nThis garnered national media attention and many lawyers noted that this was illegal.\nThe below uses the data that UDOH claimed justified the policy. It shows clearly that the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization increases greatly with age (across all comorbidities). Although there are differences between non-White and White patients, the differences are small compared to the effect of age."
